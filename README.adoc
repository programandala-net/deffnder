== Description

DEFFNder is a small library of Sinclair BASIC functions written in
Z80.

Some of the functions are generic and can be found in more powerful
BASICs; other functions are very specific, written to be used in
certain projects.

The functions are relocatable and ready to be used. Usage instructions
of every function are included in the source code.

Related links and highlighted sources can be found on
http://programandala.net/en.program.deffnder.html[the DEFFNder web
page].

== Authors

Marcos Cruz (programandala.net) wrote the first 15 functions (4 of
them based on code published in Microhobby in 1986 and 1987, mainly by
Ricardo Serrial Wigge; full details are in the sources).

Derek Bolli (dbolli at bigpond dot net dot au) contributed 5 more
functions and the demo program.

== Files and directories

<README.adoc>::

  This file.

<LICENSE.txt>::

  The tiny license of DEFFNder.

<Makefile>::

  The makefile for the make utility. Usage:

  * `make` builds the TAP files.
  * `make dsk` builds the TAP files and a DSK file for +3.
  * `make mgt` builds the TAP files and a MGT file for +D.
  * `make zip` creates a ZIP file.

<sys/gplusdos-sys-2a.tap>::

  The G+DOS system file included in the MGT disk image for +D.

<src/>::

  Z80 source files of the functions.

<bin/>::

  Binary files: one TAP file for every function; <deffnder.tap>,
  <deffnder.dsk> (a +3DOS disk image) and <deffender.mgt> (a G+DOS
  disk image) contain all of them.  Also the Z80 symbols files of the
  functions are stored here; they are created by the assembler and are
  useful to know the lenght of the object code.

<demo/>::

  A complete demo program, ready to be used, with source code.

== Requirements

DEFFNder is distributed in a ZIP file that includes the sources and
the compiled binaries (in TAP, DSK and MGT files), ready to be used.

In order to compile the sources yourself, the following programs are
required:

* Pasmo (by Juli√°n Albo):
  http://pasmo.speccy.org/
* Optionally (to create the DSK file):
  tap2dsk from the Taptools (by John Elliott):
  http://www.seasip.info/ZX/unix.html
* Optionally (to create the MGT file):
  mkmgt (by Marcos Cruz):
  http://programandala.net/en.program.mkmgt.html
